The App allows you to control the car both manually through a joystick, and automatically through the distance sensors upon the vehicle itself.

Iphone 8! On anything else it looks wonky, and it might break the view.

The sensors aren't actually 360 degrees or highly calibrated, so it bumps into walls often. If I increase the distance detected past 300, it turns at anything it barely sees. So that's unhelpful. Oh and velcro isn't a very sturdy tool to build a car out of.

I still want it to read pressure, temperature, and humidity data, and make it take samples occasionally, so it will be more Mars Rover-like while being able to roam the earth.

Uhh. Thanks WrathChaos/Kuray Ogun/freedom 27 on github for allowing me to steal their cocoa pods to allow our phone to actually implement MJPEG streams.


Self Evaluation:

OH SO MANY THINGS WENT WRONG YOU HAVE NO IDEA. During the entire building process, I couldn't get the velcros attached properly, so a few days were spent figuring out where to place the dual locks and velcro strips. The wires started sparking, and I panicked a few times, due to the fire hazards. I was originally overwhelmed with the amount of wires on the damn thing, and I got confused during the building process. In the coding process, I had to figure out how the x and y values worked on the thumbstick, and even truly then, it couldn't turn at the same time as going forwards, due to the x and y coordinates being so clashing. I was applying physics and angles to find the pitch and roll, and it confused me because almost all the time the tilt sensor never worked. By the time it did work though, it was kind of to late. I couldn't figure out how the spatial phidget worked, so this is the most stable project you are going to get from me. I guess if a lot less time was spent on brute forcing the entire car to work, I would've had much more time to complete the entire car. I almost never fell behind schedule except at the end. If I had to do something differently, I guess I wish I had gotten a bit more time to work with the spatial Phidgets. The reason I fell behind was the lack of time to work on the amount of stuff for the spatial Phidget. If I were to do this app all over again, I wish I was given more time to tinker and play with the spatial phidget, because I still have no clue on what the gyroscope, magnetometer, and the spatial sensor does. I just feel that there were missed opportunities to figure out what directions would work, or potentially using the gyroscope to tell whats the angle of a measured surface. Uhh, I can't list anything off the top of my head that will earn me more grades.
